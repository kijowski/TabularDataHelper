# [Tabular Data Helper](http://kijowski.github.io/TabularDataHelper/)
> Web utility for working with tabular data.

During my regular job I had to deal with tabular data from various sources on semi-regular basis. Because of that I have created this simple utility to scratch my personal itch.

I'm not a experienced front-end developer but working on this mini-project was fun and I learned more about [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org),  [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and their interoperability.
